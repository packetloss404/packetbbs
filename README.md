**A community BBS for builders, tinkerers, and curious minds.**

PacketBBS is the self-hosted community node in the Packet family: a place for callers, messages, files, chat, and doors. Connect by Telnet for the authentic experience or use the browser terminal. Both transports feed one shared session engine, so callers across 16 nodes see each other in real time.

The original vibe-coding personality still has a home. **Vibe Community** is a deliberately neon corner of the message network, joined by the Vibe Lounge and named door worlds. It is part of PacketBBS, not the premise of the whole system.

## Direction

PacketBBS is evolving toward a local-first community node inspired by the best interaction patterns of early- and late-1990s BBS systems:

- A caller loop centered on mail waiting, new-message scans, new files, callers, doors, and deliberate logoff
- Clear separation between local E-Mail, local conferences, shared PacketNet echoes, routed NetMail, and external NetNews
- Offline **Packet Briefcase** and QWK/REP workflows for reading and replying away from the live connection
- Curated file libraries, daily-turn doors, compact caller profiles, last-callers lists, and other small features that make a community feel inhabited
- Authenticated store-and-forward federation only after local threading, unread state, moderation, and delivery queues are reliable

The first traditional-BBS milestone is implemented: callers now receive a “Since Your Last Call” summary, use a compact conventional command shell, can persist novice/expert/super menu modes, run a real unread scan across conferences, distinguish public follow-ups from private replies, and view Last Callers. The existing special-interest boards are grouped under **Vibe Community**.

The [traditional BBS research and loop design](docs/TRADITIONAL-BBS-RESEARCH.md) records the TriBBS, Spitfire, PCBoard, WWIV, Renegade, and Synchronet comparison. The broader network proposal, migration constraints, risks, and phased review checklist live in [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md).

## Features

- **Hybrid Access** — Raw Telnet server (TCP 2323, real IAC negotiation) + browser web terminal (xterm.js over WebSocket) with CRT scanline effect, both driving one `BBSSession` engine
- **Multi-Node Concurrency** — Up to 16 simultaneous users with cross-protocol broadcasts: login/logout/disconnect notices, SysOp pages, and new-mail alerts reach online users regardless of how they connected
- **Traditional Caller Loop** — A post-authentication “Since Your Last Call” summary, message/mail/new-file counts, previous caller, calls today, Last Callers, deliberate logoff, and persisted novice/expert/super menu modes
- **ANSI Art UI** — Full-color retro interface with box drawing, gradients, and block art throughout (~40-state ANSI session machine, hand-written byte-level input parsing including backspace and Telnet IAC)
- **Message Conferences** — 5 threaded conferences with access-level gating, per-user read tracking, correct global/per-conference newscan, public follow-up versus private reply, and a `/S` save / `/A` abort multi-line editor
- **Electronic Mail** — Person-to-person mail with inbox/read/reply/delete, recipient validation, unread counts in the caller summary and main prompt, and live "new mail" push if the recipient is currently online
- **Polls & Voting Booth** — Interactive polls with one-vote-per-user enforcement (DB-level unique constraint) and results rendered as percentage ASCII bar charts
- **TeleChat** — 3 live rooms with real cross-node message relay scoped per room, join/leave announcements, and `/W` who's-here
- **One-Liners** — A compact caller wall; usernames are ANSI-stripped before display
- **Vibe Community** — Grouped boards for AI-assisted building, agents, prompts, and experimental workflows
- **5 Door Games** — Two classic-inspired ports, two originals, and an AI Dungeon Master MUD powered by Claude
- **SysOp Tools** — MOTD-on-login, SysOp paging (blinking alert to every level-200+ node), who's-online, system stats, and a token-authenticated web admin dashboard
- **File Libraries** — 4 browsable catalog areas for utilities, text files, caller uploads, and ANSI art (listing/catalog; transfer not yet wired)
- **Persistent Storage** — SQLite (better-sqlite3, WAL mode, 14 tables) with scrypt-hashed passwords and call logging

## Roadmap Summary

1. **Traditional caller shell — shipped in 1.2.0** — reliable unread newscan, last-call summary, Last Callers, menu modes, conventional labels, public/private reply split, and idempotent disconnect cleanup
2. **Reader continuity** — subscriptions, high-water pointers, catch-up, mark unread, quoted replies, search, and remembered current conference
3. **Message and E-Mail foundation** — stable global IDs, real thread metadata, database-backed areas, Inbox/Sent/Saved/Drafts, moderation, and personal filters
4. **Offline packets and file libraries** — Packet Briefcase, QWK/REP, search, extended file descriptions, batch downloads, and upload quarantine
5. **PacketNet lab and adapters** — signed node identities, scheduled mail runs, trusted hub fan-out, retries, deduplication, authenticated NNTP, and optional FTN/FidoNet support

See [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) for acceptance criteria and protocol references.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:packetloss404/packetbbs.git
cd packetbbs
npm install
npm start
```

Then connect:

| Method | Address |
|--------|---------|
| Web Terminal | http://localhost:8088 |
| Admin Panel | http://localhost:8088/admin |

**Default login:** `SysOp` / `sysop`

Validate the codebase with the same syntax-and-test loop used for this milestone:

```bash
npm run verify
```

## Screenshots (What You'll See)

PacketBBS renders the caller experience entirely in ANSI art. Here's what the flow looks like:

```

Both Telnet and WebSocket connections construct the same `BBSSession` over a tiny `transport` shim (`write`/`end`). Telnet sends real IAC negotiation bytes (`WILL ECHO`, `WILL/DO SUPPRESS-GO-AHEAD`) and parses raw input byte-by-byte; WebSocket adds ping/pong keepalive for idle timeout. The `NodeManager` tracks every active node across both transports as a `node → {session, username, activity}` map and provides `broadcast()`, which powers cross-protocol login/logout/paging/new-mail announcements.

## Message Conferences

| # | Conference | Description | Access |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | General Discussion | Chat about anything and everything | All users |
| 3 | Show & Tell | Share projects, experiments, art, and hardware | All users |
| 2 | Vibe Coding | Swap notes on AI-assisted building and experiments | All users |
| 4 | AI Workflows | Discuss agents, prompts, context files, and tools | All users |
| 5 | SysOp Corner | System administration discussion | SysOp only |

Messages support threading (replies), per-user read tracking via the `message_read` join table, access-level gating per conference, and writing with `/S` to save and `/A` to abort.

The message menu renders section headings from `config.json`. General Discussion and Show & Tell form the Main Board; Vibe Coding and AI Workflows form Vibe Community; SysOp Corner remains a restricted System conference. Numeric IDs are intentionally stable so existing posts do not need a data migration.

## Electronic Mail

Person-to-person messaging backed by a dedicated `private_mail` table:

- Send, inbox, read, reply, and delete
- Recipient existence validation with canonical casing
- Unread counts surfaced as a badge on login
- Real-time "you've got mail" push when the recipient is online on any node

## Polls / Voting Booth

An interactive voting subsystem (`polls`, `poll_options`, `poll_votes` tables):

- One vote per user, enforced by a `UNIQUE(poll_id, user_id)` constraint
- Live results rendered as percentage ASCII bar charts
- Ships with a seeded sample poll on first run

## TeleChat & One-Liners

- **TeleChat** — 3 rooms with real-time cross-node message relay scoped to the room you're in, plus join/leave announcements and `/W` to see who's present. Vibe Lounge retains the neon annex's personality.
- **One-Liners** — Leave a compact message for other callers. Usernames are ANSI-stripped before rendering so nobody can break the layout.

## File Libraries

| # | Area | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | Utilities | Useful scripts, tools, and small programs |
| 2 | Text Files & Docs | Guides, notes, zines, and reference material |
| 3 | Community Uploads | Files shared by PacketBBS callers |
| 4 | ANSI Art | ANSI art files and packs |

> Note: file areas are browsable catalogs (listing + metadata). Actual upload/download transfer is not yet wired.

## Door Games

Prompt Quest, Token Tycoon, and Stack Overflow sit in the general arcade. Vibe Wars and Dungeon of the Vibe Lords retain their names as part of the Vibe corner's personality.

### 🚀 Vibe Wars
*Inspired by TradeWars 2002*

Intergalactic AI resource trading across 8 sectors with a per-sector price model and volatility. Buy and sell GPU Cores, Training Data, Model Weights, API Tokens, Prompt Packs, and VRAM Chips. Navigate probabilistic pirate encounters, manage fuel, cargo, and hull, and maximize your fortune in 30 turns with end-of-game scoring.

### ⚔️ Prompt Quest
*Inspired by Legend of the Red Dragon*

Dungeon crawler where you descend through floors fighting 8 scaling dev-bug monsters — from Null Pointers to the dreaded Prod Outage Dragon. Earn XP and gold, level up, buy weapons (Rubber Duck → Claude Opus Staff) and potions, and see how deep you can go.

### 💰 Token Tycoon
*Original*

Build an AI startup from $5,000 to IPO in 24 months. Hire engineers, buy compute, train models, run marketing campaigns, and acquire customers via real revenue/cost formulas. Random events like viral tweets, angel investors, and AWS bill surprises keep every playthrough different. Graded S through F on final valuation.

### 📚 Stack Overflow
*Original*

Developer-themed hangman with 80 words across four categories: Programming Languages, Frameworks & Tools, Dev Concepts, and AI & Vibe Coding. Guess the word before your stack overflows (6 wrong = crash). Multi-round scoring with running win rate.

### 🧠 Dungeon of the Vibe Lords
*AI-Powered MUD — Claude is your Dungeon Master*

A live AI-narrated dungeon crawl beneath the ruins of a crashed production server. Claude acts as your Dungeon Master, generating room descriptions, NPC dialogue, combat encounters, puzzles, and loot — all in real-time over a telnet terminal.

**What makes it special:**
- **Freeform input** — Type anything. "Search the corpse," "bribe the goblin," "cast a mass rollback on the corrupted database." Claude handles it all.
- **Persistent characters** — Your adventure saves to the database. Log off, come back tomorrow, and the dungeon remembers you. Conversation history is preserved so Claude maintains narrative continuity.
- **Full RPG mechanics** — HP, XP, gold, attack, defense, inventory, leveling with stat growth and full heals. Death is permanent (roguelike).
- **Dev-themed world** — Rooms are server rooms, corrupted codebases, and haunted CI/CD pipelines. Monsters are race conditions, memory leaks, and hallucinating LLMs. Loot is mechanical keyboards and ancient documentation scrolls.
- **Leaderboard** — Hall of Fame ranked by level, monsters slain, and deepest floor reached.

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` (see `.env.example`). Without it, the dungeon entrance displays a "sealed" message.


## Admin Panel

The SysOp admin panel is a web-based single-file vanilla-JS SPA at `/admin` with a retro green-on-black terminal aesthetic, served by Express with token auth (`/admin/api/*` routes gated by a `requireAuth` middleware; login requires access level ≥ 200).

- **Dashboard** — Live stats (users, messages, calls, uptime), online nodes, recent call log
- **User Management** — List, delete, reset passwords, edit access levels (password hashes stripped from API responses)
- **Message Management** — Browse by conference, delete individual messages
- **Bulletin Management** — Create, toggle active/inactive, delete announcements
- **Node Monitoring** — Real-time view of who's online and what they're doing

## Configuration

All settings live in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "bbsName": "PacketBBS",
  "sysopName": "SysOp",
  "telnetPort": 2323,
  "webPort": 8088,
  "maxNodes": 16,
  "allowNewUsers": true,
  "idleTimeout": 300,
  "messageBases": [ ... ],
  "fileAreas": [ ... ]
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `telnetPort` | 2323 | Telnet server port |
| `webPort` | 8088 | Web terminal & admin panel port |
| `maxNodes` | 16 | Maximum simultaneous connections |
| `allowNewUsers` | true | Allow new user registration |
| `idleTimeout` | 300 | Seconds before idle disconnect |
| `newUserLevel` | 10 | Access level for new accounts |
| `sysopLevel` | 255 | Maximum access level |

## Database

PacketBBS uses SQLite through better-sqlite3 in WAL mode. New installations use `data/packetbbs.db`; when only an existing `data/vibebbs.db` is present, PacketBBS continues using it in place so the rename cannot strand caller data. `PACKETBBS_DB_PATH` can explicitly select another location.

The 14-table schema is created incrementally on startup and seeded on a brand-new board via namespaced CRUD modules over prepared statements:

- **users** — Accounts with scrypt-hashed passwords (per-user salt), access levels, caller stats, and persistent menu mode
- **messages** — Threaded messages organized by conference
- **message_read** — Per-user read tracking for unread counts
- **bulletins** — SysOp announcements with active/inactive toggle
- **files** — File metadata with download counts
- **call_log** — Login/logout history per node
- **graffiti** — Graffiti wall entries
- **private_mail** — Person-to-person mail with read/unread state
- **polls**, **poll_options**, **poll_votes** — Polls, their choices, and one-vote-per-user records
- **motd** — Message of the day shown on login
- **dungeon_players**, **dungeon_history** — Persistent character state and AI-dungeon context

The default SysOp account, welcome content, a sample poll, MOTD, and starter graffiti are seeded automatically on first launch.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
